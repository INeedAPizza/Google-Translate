First_Steps.py is a python program for a simple intro into the Googletrans python module.

Just_Chaos_Now.py is a python program converting a word, phrase, poem, or other text through Googletrans several times,
sending you a message when it is completed, and finally spewing out a text-to-speech mp3 file.

You will need to install the googletrans library for both programs, and the gtts, playsound, os, and plyer libraries for Just_Chaos_Now.
All of them are pip compatible, for example: pip install googletrans.

I hope you enjoy!
